# Key definitions
- Attack rate
  - The proportion of the population which contracts the disease from the population at risk

- Case-fatality risk (CFR)
  - The probability that a person dies from an infection given that they are a case

- Infection-fatality risk (IFR)
  - Defines a case as a person who has shown evidence of infection, either by clinical detection of the pathogen or by seroconversion or other immune response
  
- Basic reproductive number **R0** (often pronounced _"R naught"_)
  - The **average number of secondary cases** of an infection that occur **in a completely
susceptible population following a single infectious case**

.footnote[[Lipsitch, 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003846); case-fatality risk and infection-fatality risk are sometimes referred to as "rates".]

 # Contemporary epidemics history

- **2002-2004** **SARS** (SARS-CoV virus)
    - R0: 2.0 to 4.0 ([WHO, 2003](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf))

 # Emerging Infectious Diseases
**Identification of infectious agents and diseases that were not recognized before**

## Infection states

- Progression-Related

State of Infection | Definition
 -------------|--------------------------------------
Colonization | Transient colonization tissue invasion
Subclinical infection | Agent is present in host tissues without signs, symptoms, or laboratory evidence of tissue damage
Latency | Infection in which the agent has invaded the host and is in a nonreplicating, noninfectious, but viable state
Disease | Agent is replicating in host tissues with signs, symptoms, or laboratory evidence of tissue damage
Cure | Agent has been eliminated from host tissue (may persist on surface)

---
# Infection states

- Transmission-Related

State of Infection | Definition
 --------|---------|---------
Preinfectious | Host is infected but has not become infectious
Infectious | Host is capable of transmitting agent to others
Postinfectious | Host is no longer capable of transmission

.footnote[Rothman KJ, Modern Epidemiology, 3rd Edition]

# Modeling infectious diseases spread
- **Aims**
  - Prediction
  - Consequences of intervention ("causal" flavour and counterfactual reasoning)
- **Models**
  - **Deterministic compartmental models (DCMs)**
      - SIR (Susceptible → Infectious → Recovered)
      - SIRS (Susceptible → Infectious → Recovered → Susceptible)
      - SEIR (Susceptible → Exposed → Infectious → Recovered)
      - Modifications accomodating other compartments to model post-infection immunity, vaccination, etc.
      - Straightforward, transparent, does not always reflect real-life complexities
  
  _Simulating individuals not the population groups_
  - **Agent-based models (ABMs)**
  - **Network models**

- Calibration, Validation, Sensitivity analyses

# Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak

- **SARS-CoV-2**
- β-coronavirus (other two known β-CoVs are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV)
- Origin: bats via unknown intermediate hosts to infect humans
- Uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the same receptor as SARS-CoV, to infect humans
- Incubation period
    - Median 5.1 days (4.5 to 5.8 days)
    - 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days ([mainland China data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081172))
    - China CDC: 10-14 days
    - USA CDC: [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html)
- Period of infectivity: 90% negative viral RNA tests on nasopharyngeal swabs by 10 days after the onset of symptoms ([Liu, 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2820%2930232-2))
- Immunity: preliminary data showing that neutralizing antibodies ([Kai-Wang To, 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2820%2930196-1); [Ju, 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.990770v1.full.pdf))

# Testing for COVID-19
- Different testing capacity/kits
- Different ways of recording/releasing/sharing data

- Probability of being tested is not independent of disease severity and of the outcome

- RT-PCR:
    - Tests are not perfect
      - Analytical sensitivity 95%
        - Positive (COVID-19_N_P) – positive for all targets detected (Ct < 40)
      - Analytical Specificity: no cross-reactivity [(FDA, 2020)](https://www.fda.gov/media/136151/download)
      
- No reliable data on comparative accuracy of oropharyngeal vs nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis of COVID-19 [(The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford University)](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/comparative-accuracy-of-oropharyngeal-and-nasopharyngeal-swabs-for-diagnosis-of-covid-19/)

---
**Beware of bias when interpreting case-fatality rate**
- The data we use to estimate the CFR are often gathered for other purposes
- Challenging & constantly changing circumstances
- Preferential testing and counting of severe cases → overestimation
- At any point during ongoing epidemic we haven't yet observed disease outcomes for everyone → underestimation
- Delayed reporting: outcomes observed now are reported later
- Forward contact tracing → pre-symptomatic individuals → less prone to bias CFR estimates

- Comparison of CFR across groups
  - E.g., hospitalized vs non-hospitalized → multiple competing biases
      - Suvivorship
      - Selection
      - Confounding

- Inference is never based on available data alone
    - Data collection + what we did not collect + what we collected + assumptions

# Treatment of COVID-19
- No specific treatment available
  - Oxygenation support for severely ill

- Clinical trials for variety of agents (antiviral, immune modulators, antibacterial, monoclonal antibodies, etc.)
  - Chloqoquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, tocilizumab, camostat mesilate, sargramostim, colchicine, imatinib, IFNβ-1a, inhaled steroids, remdesivir, oseltamivir, etc. [(EU Clinical Trial Register;](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=covid-19) [laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk)](https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/da/nyheder/temaer/ny-coronavirus-covid-19/~/media/5B83D25935DF43A38FF823E24604AC36.ashx)
  - Mind the comparison groups and design features

- Available results
  - Lopinavir-ritonavir vs standard care showed no decrease in mortality of COVID-19 patients [(Cao, 2020)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282?query=featured_coronavirus)

# Points of concern
.left[
- Design
  - In essence - observational study without adjustment for the sources of bias
- "Control group" ascertainment
    - Refused consent to receive active treatment → allocated to "control group"
    - Ethically and methodologically problematic
- Loss-to-follow-up (selection bias)
    - From 26 patients in "treatment group", 6 were excluded (4 out of 6 developed severe disease/died)
    - Could make the treatment look beneficial when it isn't
- Outcome (SARS-CoV-2+/- on day 6)
  - Dichotomization of viral load
  - Day 6
      - No biologic justification
      - Missing outcome data
      - Some patients were positive on day 6 but negative on day 9; one was negative on day 6 but positive on day 8
      - PCR procedure different from the official CDC protocol
      - Clinical relevance of the end-point
